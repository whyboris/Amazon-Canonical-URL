# Amazon Canonical URL

A _Chrome_ extension that lets you copy the _canonical_ URL for any product on _Amazon_ to your clipboard when you click on its icon.

### Notes

- Logs to the _console_ in _Developer Tools_
- If it fails to copy to clipboard, just reload the page and try again
- Works on _Amazon.com_ pages but will do nothing on any other website
